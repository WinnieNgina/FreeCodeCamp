﻿/*
* Here are the rules for the battle game that you need to implement in your code project:
* You must use either the do-while statement or the while statement as an outer game loop.
* The hero and the monster will start with 10 health points.
* All attacks will be a value between 1 and 10.
* The hero will attack first.
* Print the amount of health the monster lost and their remaining health.
* If the monster's health is greater than 0, it can attack the hero.
* Print the amount of health the hero lost and their remaining health.
* Continue this sequence of attacking until either the monster's health or hero's health is zero or less.
* Print the winner.
